# Sea Level Indicators

A containerized version of the Sea Level Indicators data pipeline that calculates El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Indian Ocean Diple sea level indicator values from along track satellite data.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo: https://github.com/kevinmarlis/enso-pipeline

Pulling the image: `docker pull kmarlis/enso-pipeline:latest`

## Executing the container

The pipeline requires mounting two directories: one containing the alongtrack data, and one containing the pipeline output. 

```
docker run --rm -dit -v /export/01/dev-data3/alongtrack-delivery/:/alongtrack-delivery -v /home/marlis/pipeline_output:/pipeline_output kmarlis/enso-pipeline:latest
```

This will mount the appropriate directories and will execute the pipeline end to end. There are checks in place so that redundant work will not be performed.
